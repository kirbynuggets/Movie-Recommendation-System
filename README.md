# Movie-Recommendation-System

This movie recommendation system is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The project structure is as follows:

* Collaborative-Based Filtering.ipynb: This notebook implements a collaborative filtering approach to recommend movies based on user behavior and preferences.
* Content-Based Filtering.ipynb: This notebook uses content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their attributes and features.
* Popularity-Based Filtering.ipynb: This notebook recommends movies based on their popularity and user ratings.

(The .csv files contain the dataset used for training and testing the recommendation models.)
